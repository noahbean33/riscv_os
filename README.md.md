# NOVIX Compilation Guide

## Prerequisites

Before compiling this project, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- `mkfs.fat`
- `nasm`
- `i686-elf-gcc`
- `i686-elf-ld`

---

## Configuration

### 1. Edit the Makefile

Before starting the build process, open the main `Makefile` and make sure to:

- Set the **absolute path** to each required tool:
  - `mkfs.fat`
  - `nasm`
  - `i686-elf-gcc`
  - `i686-elf-ld`
- Specify the **absolute path** to `libgcc.a`.  
  This is necessary because `i686-elf-gcc` **does not include it automatically** during linking.

#### Example Configuration

```makefile
FAT=mkfs.fat
ASM=nasm
CC=/home/novice/cross/i686-elf/bin/i686-elf-gcc
LD=/home/novice/cross/i686-elf/bin/i686-elf-ld
LIBGCC_PATH=/home/novice/cross/i686-elf/lib/gcc/i686-elf/14.2.0
```

---

### 2. Building the Project

Once all paths are correctly configured, run the following command to build the project:

```bash
make
```

The compiled binary will be generated in the output directory specified in your `Makefile`.

---

## Running the OS

After compilation, you can run the NOVIX operating system using one of the following options:

### Using QEMU

Run the following script to launch NOVIX with QEMU:

```bash
./run.sh
```

### Using Bochs

Alternatively, to launch NOVIX using Bochs, run:

```bash
./runbochs
```

> Make sure that both scripts (`run.sh` and `runbochs`) are executable:
>
> ```bash
> chmod +x run.sh runbochs
> ```

---

## debugging

we use QEMU with the GDB remote stub.

**Running the Kernel in QEMU with GDB:**

1. Start QEMU in debug mode:
```bash
qemu-system-i386 -s -S -debugcon stdio -m 64M -fda build/main.img
```

2. Start GDB (in a another terminal):
```bash
gdb build/kernel.elf
```

3. Connect to QEMU:
```bash
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
```

4. Set breakpoints (for example at start or any function you want to inspect):
```bash
(gdb) break start
(gdb) continue
```
